# Image Gallery Widget for Bounty StackUp

The custom widget that I made is an image gallery widget. I think it suits with the planner app because the planner app will be more personalized.

For this widget, I display 9 images that are already in a folder (image-server) and the data saved into an array then the images will be displayed in a widget sequentially.

I also add a button (dots) feature that according to the number of available images. The image will appear when the button is clicked and it will also be alternately changed or appear with 2.5 seconds transition-delay. There is a tittle/ name/ description under each image.
